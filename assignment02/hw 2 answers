1. 

a) Value of the counter in locals window is -2147483648
b) Value of the counter in the Registers is 0x80000000
c)both N and V flags are set in the APSR N is for negative V is for overflow 
because the value 0x7FFFFFFF is the largest positive 2's compliment value
when 1 gets added Ox80000000 becomes smallest possible negative number for that resolution (number of bytes)
so it overflowed and became negative

2.

a) value switched from -1 to 0 
b) the zero and carry flags were 1

because the number FFFFFFFF (maxed out ones in binary) incremented by 1 becomes all zeros with 1 
carried over. It's not an overflow because 0 is within the range of this 2's compliment value
with the associated number of bytes. So the value was zero and there was a carry.

3.

a)The value is 2147483648
b) Both N and V flags are set in the APSR N is for negative V is for overflow. 
The register expects it to be in 2's compliment doesn't see it as unsigned.

4.

a) value is zero (makes sense b/c it's no longer at max value has to circle over)
b) Zero and Carry bits are set because it was at zero and the previous step carried a value over

5. 

Move the “counter’ variable outside of main (at the top of the file):
a) The scope of the variable is Gloabal.
b) Counter not viewable in local anymore.
c) Counter can be tracked in "watch" now.
d) Counter address is 0x20000000

6.

a) Value of counter is 4.
b) Program increases the value of the variable at the *p_inint location.

7.

a) 0x20000000 is the location of the variable
b) RAM random access memory
c) Value is 4
