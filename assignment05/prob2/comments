Very strange the output did not post. 
I loaded in the original main file from the example and that one would not post either.
I think its a glitch w/my board or somehting I had a similar problem happen to me on assignment 3 when my LED wouldn't blink but the code made it blink on a colleague's laptop
so I just restarted my computer a few times and eventually it blinked (same code and everything). I'm guessing it's one of those errors.
