 a. How does the calling function “func2” pass the values to the called function “func1”?
 
 It loads the first value into R0 then it loads R0 into the SP then it loads the following 4 values into R3 through R1.
 Then inside of func1 it loads the SP into R4 and passes the values using R4 and the rest of the registers.
 
b. What extra code did the compiler generate before calling the function “func1” with the
multiple arguments?

All I saw was it loading the registers and sending one of the values to the SP before BL to func1

c. What extra code did the compiler generate inside the called function “funct1” with the
multiple list of arguments?

for some reason it pushes PUSH {R4, R5} to the stack
then it loads the previously pushed value back to R4 to be used in the program.

d. Any other observations?

I'm not sure why it pushed {R4, R5} to the stack before bringing the value back.
