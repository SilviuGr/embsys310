a. What instructions does the compiler produce in assembly for “writing” to the GPIO bit
when using bit-band address?

MOVS moves value 1 into a register
LDR.N loads the bit band address to register R1
STR   stores 1 into the memory stored in R1

b. What were the instructions produced when writing to the GPIOx_ODR without using bitbanding?

LDR.N loads the address of the GPIOA into R2
LDR   loads the value of R2 into R3
ORRSW ors R3 with the bit value to set the appropriate GPIOA bit to 1
STR stores R3 to the address in R2
